Contributing Overview
---------------------

Because we are using Github the process for contributing is as follows:

1. We acquire a github account. https://github.com
2. We fork Brandon/Skyfield's repo. https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield
3. We git clone our Fork to a local working copy on our own machine. git clone https://github.com/<YOUR ID HERE>/python-skyfield
4. We create development branches in our own working copy. git checkout -b Issue14
5. We code by adding/modifying/deleting documentation or code
6. We commit git commit -m "#31 Fix involved: blah blah blah"
7. We push our fix branches to our Forked repo. git push origin Issue14
8. On Github we submit a pull request from this forked branch into Brandon/Skyfield's main repo.

Between fixes we can do pull requests from Brandon/Skyfield's repo into our own Fork's master branch keeping our master updated.
