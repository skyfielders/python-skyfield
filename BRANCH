This ‘investigate-moon-rising’ branch has gone on long enough that I
need some notes, to remember which scripts are important and where it’s
heading each time I sit down to work on it again.

The goal is to land on `master` the changes in `skyfield/almanac.py` for
the new rising / setting routine, so that it no longer misses edge-case
high-latitude rises and sets where the Sun or Moon barely grazes the
horizon.  See:

https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield/issues/998

Here are the various test scripts that I’ve touched along the way, in
rough order of importance:

design/test_sunrise_moonrise.py

  Crucial investigation script, that I want to keep!  Tests the rising
  routine against one normal year of USNO sunrise, then one normal year
  of moonrise, then a difficult year of latitude 70° moonrise.  For each
  year, shows the two worse risings by stepping through the adjacent
  milliseconds so that I can see whether rising really intersected the
  correct millisecond.  Also is fun to run to see the difference in
  speed between the old and new routines!

design/plot_search_for_rising.py

  KEEP.  Draws a plot tmp.png to show the search for a particular rising
  that I’m curious about, that the above script shows as one of the 70°
  worse cases.  I’m wondering why the search never reaches the exact
  millisecond of rising.

design/illustrate_moonrise_edge_case.py

  DISCARD.  Big sprawling script that started out merely drawing a plot,
  but wound up having prototype versions of several ‘final step’ search
  routines before the winner was selected.  I’m mining it for ideas as I
  write the above script as a keepable replacement.

design/test_moonrise_edge.py

design/intersect_function.py

  KEEP, in case I ever want to revisit its design and tweak it more.
